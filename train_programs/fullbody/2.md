*The lower body day is as follows:*

•   4 sets of [pistol squats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZlLHZ4Venw)
•   4 sets of [walking lunges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYWhkctnP2o)
•   4 sets of a 20 second sprint or 40 meeters.

Perform every exercise for as many reps as you can, and make sure to do them in the order given, its designed from the hardest exercise to the easiest.

For the pistol squats, you probably won’t be able to do them straight away, that’s fine. Go ahead and google search “pistol squat progression” and you will get an idea of where to start and how to progress from there.
