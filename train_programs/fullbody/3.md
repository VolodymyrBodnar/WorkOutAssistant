•   Do more reps then last time
•   Do more sets then last time
•   Make the exercise your doing harder e.g instead of doing push ups, do dips
•   Reduce your rest time, or do exercises back to back

_Don’t get hung up on trying to make large leaps from workout to workout. This may be the case in some, but treat that more like a bonus. In reality you will be making small progressions each workout._

*The upper body,  day 3 is as follows:*
•   3 sets of [pull ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGo4IYlbE5g)
•   3 sets of [dips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8JmcrW-As)
•   3 sets of [chin ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brhRXlOhsAM)
•   3 sets of [push ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUcvA5351kk)

_Perform every exercise for as many reps as you can, and make sure to do them in the order given, its designed from the hardest exercise to the easiest._

*It’s not a really fancy or elaborate workout, but it doesn’t need to be. In calisthenics, the simple exercises are usually the most effective, and this workout is no exception.*
