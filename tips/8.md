*Give high-intensity interval training a try.*

High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, refers to short bursts of very hard work followed by periods of recovery—they don’t call it high intensity for nothing. The work periods are typically 20 to 90 seconds, during which you should be giving it your all, whether that’s a sprint on a treadmill or nonstop burpees.

The main appeal of a HIIT workout is that it's incredibly efficient. Because you're packing in so much work during those hard intervals—and keeping your heart rate up during your rest—you're doing a whole lot of work in a short period of time. This improves your aerobic fitness and, if you're including strength exercises in your HIIT session, your muscle strength and/or endurance as well.
